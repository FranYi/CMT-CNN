By Dan Xu, Wanli Ouyang, Elisa Ricci, Xiaogang Wang and Nicu Sebe
## Introduction
CMT-CNN is a pedestrian detection approach asscoiated to an arxiv submission https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02431 which is accepted at CVPR 2017. The code is implemented with Caffe and based on the Faster-RCNN framework.
The code has been tested under the configurations of Ubuntu 14.04, MATLAB 2015b and CUDA 8.0.
